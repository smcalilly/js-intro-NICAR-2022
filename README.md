# JavaScript Intro - NICAR 2022

## Folders in this repo
- `lesson`
  - This will be the code you edit. I've already created a couple of empty script files for you, as well as a skeleton index.html page.
- `demo`
  - The end result of the code if you get stuck or want to just peruse or return to at a later time.

## Lesson plan
I'm following along with the outline I wrote in [lesson.md](lesson.md). You can return here after this session, but it might be confusing if you try to read along while we do live coding.

## Resources
Here's some places for continued learning:
- [Eloquent Javascript book](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) - free
- [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/) - free
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) - free
- [Learn Enough JavaScript](https://www.learnenough.com/javascript-tutorial) - paid
- a good place to continue learning HTML and CSS: https://htmlandcssguidebook.com/index.html

If you get stuck, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a good place to search. You'll get the most mileage if you learn how to search specific errors that are logged in your console.

If you return to this material after this NICAR session, feel free to [email me](mail-to:smcalilly@gmail.com) if you have any questions or need any clarification about this material.
